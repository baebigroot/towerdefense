# towerdefense

The game involves defending a king's tower, located at the end of a known path, against incoming attacking units using strategically placed towers. The objective of the game is to prevent the tower from being destroyed, which will result in the end of the game.

The game will be automated, with the algorithm determining the placement of defense towers, and random attacking units appearing at the beginning of the path. During gameplay, the program will traverse a linked list of units, deleting any unit with zero or negative points before moving on to the next one.

Programming concepts included : conditional statements, probability, linked lists, memory management, etc.
